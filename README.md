# RayKin

Minimal C++ Robotics Kinematis demo app. Uses C++ RayLib for visualization.
User can modifty the robot joint MDH table & rotate the joints using pgUp & pgDown or by typing a value.

**Current State: **
Currently implements robot loading from an urdf-style xml file, mdh-table modification, forward kinematics and a usable working user interface.
** Next Features: ** 
Plan is to implement a dampened minimal least square-based inverse kinematics solver.
